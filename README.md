AI to find your items !

## THE ISSUE
Have you ever lost an item? In your house, in your bag or in a drawer?
A friend of ours once lost a passport the night before flying to Thailand and she spent hours looking for it!

## Our magic Solution!
We use AI and visual recognition to find your lost items! There already are apps to find your keys for instance but you need to put a connected key chain on it. With our solution no need for device, just your phone and it also works offline! 

## How it works
1. Film around : just hand out your phone and scan around the room, your purse and your drawers.

2. Check if item is found : see if the item was found on the checklist.

3. Find your items : click on the checked item and see a picture of where it was last seen!
